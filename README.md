# BattleShip
A simple text based implementation of the game Battleship in Java.     
The user can pass in the size of the board, as well as the number of players and number of ships in the game.     
The boards will be randomized, with ships of various lengths placed all over the board.     
The ships have lengths of either 2, 3, 4 or a max of 5, depending on how many ships are in play.     
If for example, there are 5 ships in play, there will be one ship of length 2, 3 and 4, and two ships of length 5.     
The user and computer players then take turns attacking a square on one of the opponent's boards.     
The opponent's boards are obscured to the player, however if they get a hit a `*` will appear, and if it is a miss a `^` will appear.     
To win, the player must sink all of the other opponents' ships.
